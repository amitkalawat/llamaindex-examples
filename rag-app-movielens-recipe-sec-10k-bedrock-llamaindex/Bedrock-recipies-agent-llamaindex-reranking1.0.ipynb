Use a pasta machine to gradually roll out each piece of dough, passing it through the rollers multiple times and adjusting to narrower settings until you reach the desired thickness, around 1/16 inch thick.\\n\\n4. Cut the rolled out pasta sheets into noodles, either by hand or using the cutting attachment on the pasta machine. \\n\\n5. Allow the cut noodles to dry slightly for at least 5 minutes before cooking.\\n\\n6. Cook the fresh pasta noodles in boiling salted water for around 2 minutes until tender.\\n\\nThe context provides detailed instructions for making fresh egg fettuccine noodles as well as a basic egg pasta dough that can be shaped into various pasta types. Following the kneading, resting, rolling, and cutting steps will allow you to make fresh, homemade pasta.'"

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;5;200mThought: Okay, the calorie_metadata tool does not have specific calorie information for different types of fish. I will try looking for grilled fish recipes and their calorie counts instead.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;34mObservation: Here are two healthy grilled fish recipes from the context information that likely have calorie counts under 500 calories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Grilled Salmon with Black Beans and Piment d'Espelette Mayonnaise: This recipe features grilled salmon fillets served over black beans seasoned with onions, celery, tomatoes, jalapeños, garlic, and cumin. The black bean mixture and salmon are relatively low in calories, though the mayonnaise sauce would add some calories.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grilled Turbot Fish with Celery Leaf Salsa Verde: This recipe has grilled turbot fish cooked in foil pouches with rosemary, served with a salsa verde made from parsley, celery leaves, garlic, lemon, olive oil, and pepper flakes. Turbot is a lean, low-calorie fish, and the salsa verde is also very light, making this a low-calorie dish overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both recipes utilize lean proteins from the grilled fish along with vegetable accompaniments, keeping the overall calorie counts likely under 500 for a reasonable portion size. The olive oil used for cooking adds some healthy fats as well.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;5;200mThought: The recipies tool provided some helpful grilled fish recipe options that are likely under 500 calories. I think I have enough information now to provide a summary answer to the original question.\n",
      "Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer.\n",
      "Answer: Here are some options to create a grilled fish dish with less than 500 calories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Grilled Salmon with Black Beans: Grill a salmon fillet and serve it over a bed of black beans seasoned with onions, celery, tomatoes, jalapeños, garlic, and cumin. The salmon provides lean protein while the black beans add fiber and nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grilled Turbot with Salsa Verde: Grill turbot or another lean white fish in foil pouches with rosemary. Serve with a salsa verde made from parsley, celery leaves, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and red pepper flakes. This is a very light and low-calorie option.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Grilled Cod or Tilapia with Vegetables: Grill cod, tilapia or another mild white fish and serve with grilled or roasted vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, and asparagus tossed in a little olive oil and lemon juice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The keys are using lean proteins from grilled fish along with lots of vegetables, herbs, and limited fats/oils to keep the calorie count down while providing flavor. Avoid heavy sauces or fried components. Proper portion sizing is also important to keep it under 500 calories.\n",
